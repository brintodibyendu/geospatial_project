Developed a geospatial data science project to analyze the urban heat island effect in Manhattan by modeling spatial variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST).
Here’s a concise summary of the synthetic UHI findings for the five NYC boroughs based on your plots and statistics:

Bronx

Slope:
−
87.17
−87.17
Correlation:
−
0.99
−0.99
Interpretation: The Bronx shows the steepest negative slope and the highest (in absolute terms) correlation among the five boroughs. This implies a very strong synthetic UHI effect—temperature drops sharply with increasing distance from the borough’s centroid.
Manhattan

Slope:
−
74.43
−74.43
Correlation:
−
0.97
−0.97
Interpretation: Manhattan also exhibits a pronounced negative relationship between distance and temperature. A correlation of
−
0.97
−0.97 indicates a robust inverse link, aligning well with the classic idea of a concentrated urban core (the centroid) driving higher temperatures.
Brooklyn

Slope:
−
66.59
−66.59
Correlation:
−
0.85
−0.85
Interpretation: While still strongly negative, Brooklyn’s slope and correlation are slightly less extreme than those of the Bronx and Manhattan. This suggests a significant, but somewhat more gradual, synthetic UHI gradient.
Queens

Slope:
−
21.25
−21.25
Correlation:
−
0.39
−0.39
Interpretation: Queens shows the weakest negative slope and correlation. This could indicate a more dispersed development pattern in the synthetic model, resulting in a less pronounced “heat island” effect in relation to distance from its centroid.
Staten Island

Slope:
−
70.96
−70.96
Correlation:
−
0.92
−0.92
Interpretation: Staten Island has a notably strong inverse relationship, though not quite as extreme as the Bronx or Manhattan. The slope and correlation still suggest a robust synthetic temperature gradient from the core outward.
Overall Observations
Steepest Gradients (Bronx & Manhattan): Both boroughs exhibit very strong negative slopes and near-perfect negative correlations, indicating a sharp drop in temperature from centroid to periphery under this synthetic model.
Moderate to Strong Gradients (Brooklyn & Staten Island): These boroughs have strong, though not extreme, negative correlations. They still show clear evidence of a simulated UHI effect, just less steep than Manhattan or the Bronx.
Mildest Gradient (Queens): Queens’ comparatively gentle slope and weaker correlation suggest a more diffuse urban core, at least in this synthetic scenario.
Because this is a synthetic LST model, these results are illustrative rather than definitive. In a real-world analysis with actual temperature data, you might see different patterns influenced by factors like land cover, building density, or proximity to large bodies of water. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate how spatial distance from an “urban core” can drive temperature gradients in a simple UHI model.
